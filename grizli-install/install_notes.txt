Create a conda environment from a stenv .yaml file

first:
pip install grizli
then:
pip install "grizli[whatever you need here]"

Check instructions for GRIZLI directories and export statements in .bashrc

Check instructions for python setup functions

I needed to manually pip install dust-extinction when a notebook cell failed to import properly.
