# WIP Issues

1) Factor of 2 issue; matching scale/count rate 
    - Check scale issue with template; Sum is higher flux than template, max is close to appropriate flux
2) Wavelength-depedent PSF 

0) Producing direct image? (Minor capability for testing; we don't want to scale this)

# Going forward plans

1) [x] Track down factor of 2 error.

2) [x] Check brightest and faintest stars to correct star radius function.

3) [p] Check scale of extracted spectra.

4) [p] Apodize wavelength cuts to roll on/off when attempting wavelength-dependent PSF.

5) [x] Where does Grizli get total flux from? Direct Image? Provided Spectrum? Try doubling direct image values and comparing grism sim scale. Does it change? Do it again with provided spectrum.

6) [ ] Continue fleshing out grism_sim class in abstraction.py.

# Resolutions

1) Units error. Fixing the error assuages the issue. Switching to use the sed from HLSS products improves things further. Also, padding inclusions offsets seg map locations; need to be sure to track padding presence intentionally.

2) Using the star_radius function as found using logger pro. Wrapped in min(0, max(func, 40)) to ensure a max radius of 40 and min raiuds of 8. Testing in sim_and_extraction supports this solution.

5) Built single_object_playground. Grizli seems to get total flux from spectrum. Disperses total flux according to direct image.

# Progress

3) See single_pix.ipynb. Extracted spectrum from a single pixel object matches expectation (almost perfectly). Expectation is define: (spectrum_template * sensitivity_curve) -> summed in ~10 angstrom bins; binned array contains flux expectations. Also see sim_and_extraction: simulated each object individually to avoid contamination, and extracting in the sim for-loop. Things seem about right. Object 17127 has equal sum and max extractions, but does not sit exactly on the template. Candidate for scale checks.

4) Apodizing makes a big difference. The window needs to be refined. Try larger bins; does fewer discontinuities lower the amplitude of the erroneous wiggles? Using only 5 bins largely reduces the FFT wiggles issues, in exchange for a steps isue. Need to figure out how to smooth. Interpolation? Convolution?

6) Should build simple extraction methods next.
