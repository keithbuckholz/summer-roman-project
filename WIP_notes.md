# WIP Issues

1) Factor of 2 issue; matching scale/count rate 
2) Wavelength-depedent PSF 
3) Producing direct image? (Minor capability as of now; not scaled to full image)

# Going forward plans

1) Check medians and maxes to compare scale.
2) Check brightest and faintest stars to correct star radius function.
3) Check scale of extracted spectra.
4) Apodize wavelength cuts to roll on/off when attempting wavelength-dependent PSF.
5) [x] Where does Grizli get total flux from? Direct Image? Provided Spectrum? Try doubling direct image values and comparing grism sim scale. Does it change? Do it again with provided spectrum.

# Resolution/Progress

5) Built single_object_playground. Grizli seems to get total flux from spectrum. Disperses total flux according to direct image.
