    "When dispersing an object, Grizli takes a cutout around that object and disperses within that cutout. By default, the cutout size is determined by the size of the object alone. However, the Roman Grism's trace is sometimes larger than the cutout size. This will cause objects to fail to disperse. To prevent this, we can set a size manually. Smaller cutout sizes reduce compute times, so we want to choose the smallest neccessary cutout size. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find this size is using the Scipy Optimize module as shown below. We want the largest displacement within our bounds. So, we need to compare the absolute values of the min and max. Scipy can only find the min. So, we run Scipy twice: once with the dy function and once with a negated dy function. We compare those two values for maximum absolute value. The manually set cutout size must be an integer larger than that float value."
